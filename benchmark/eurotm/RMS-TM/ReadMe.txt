Please, cite [1] if you use RMS-TM in your research.


RMS-TM is a new TM benchmark suite that uses Recognition, Mining and Synthesis (RMS) applications.
RMS-TM applications have several important properties that make them promising candidates as good 
TM workloads, such as scalability, I/O operations inside critical sections, nested locking, and 
various percentage of the time spent in atomic sections and high commit/abort rates depending on
the application.

ReadMe-RMS-TM.txt Explains how to compile and execute RMS-TM Applications.
