The original version uses tinySTM.
We adopted it into HTM as follows:
1. Delete the file tm_spec.h
2. Change the place where tm_read_word()
e.g.
int get_val(){
  return (int)tm_read_word((void *)&m_val);
}
|||||||
int get_val(){
  int ret_val;
  TM_BEGIN();
  ret_val = m_val;
  TM_END();
  return ret_val;
}

3. Merge tm_read_word() tm_write_word()

4. stm_start() -> TM_BEGIN(); stm_commit -> TM_END(); remove their parameters accordingly.

5. Remove any counting for aborts and commits

6. Add TM_SHUTDOWN(); stm_init() -> TM_STARTUP()


7. For printf("grid: %d\n", (int)grid); comment out this one since it causes erros

8. In create_private_buffer(), change type in inside malloc to avoid seg fault
